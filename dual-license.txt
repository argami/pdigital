Dual Licensing
--------------

pDigital is available under a dual licensing [1] scheme whereby use of pDigital 
in projects that are licensed so as to be compatible with AGPL Version      
3 may use pDigital under the terms of the compatible license. Please see      
agpl-3.0.txt in the pDigital distribution for more details.                   

However, if AGPL Version 3.0 terms are incompatible with your use of        
pDigital, alternative license terms are available from Eric Ponce Rodríguez --  
please direct inquiries about pDigital licensing to ponceeric@gmail.com or  
+34 619 753362.                                                    

Why Dual Licensing?
-------------------

Dual licensing has two advantages in this case:

1. it lets us focus on building pDigital as the best available OWL reasoner

2. it lowers the barriers of evaluation and adoption for organizations who
want to try OWL and Semantic Web technologies

Which License Should I Choose?
------------------------------

If your software is licensed under a recognized open source license [2], you 
can use pDgitial under its open source license terms (see agpl-3.0.txt) without
further consideration.

However, if your software is not licensed under an open source compatible   
license, such as a proprietary license, then you should contact Eric Ponce 
Rodríguez in order to arrange alternative license terms to cover your use  
of pDigital.                                                                  

In short,

* If you derive a commercial advantage by using pDigital with a closed source 
  solution, you must arrange alternative license terms for your use of        
  pDigital which will, at a minimum, remove the need to publish your source    
  code.

* If you wish to use pDigital under its open source terms, you must           
  contribute back to the community the source code for the solution you use   
  pDigital with, so that others may benefit from it as you benefit from pDigital.
